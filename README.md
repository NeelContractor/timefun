## Key self notes 
<!-- - devnet testing on /new route. initCreator, buyTokens, sellTokens, withdrawTokenAmount, sendMessage, creatorReplyUser all handler are working but the frontend shows txns failed/in process while the explorer shows txn success.  -->
<!-- - proabably store short bio and big bio on chain -->
<!-- - /createCreator take image and store it probably ipfs or db then store the uri on-chain -->
<!-- - Home page creator card ui looks ugly, improve it -->
<!-- - add buy creator tokens on there respected /profile/[address] , also should add functionalty to fetch 10 last tranactions of creator's token mint under activity tab -->
<!-- - fix eventListeners logic on frontend, let creator see past conversation and new one coming. ..... or fix program to store creator reply to user on chain for better fetching mesasges -->
- User should have a dashboard page where user can fetch all the creator tokens. user owners and sell tokens functionalty. (dashboard creator's token fetching logic not working)
- show creator there withdraw amount and add withdraw functionality probably creator have there own dashboard
- improve ui few left // TODO add appbar to other pages
- add /message/[address] proabaly, fix ui, fix creator to user message 1 time testing it worked. if the creator is messaging user profile name is showing loading... add a placeholder for the user's profile name or if the other user is other creator show the creator's profile name.
